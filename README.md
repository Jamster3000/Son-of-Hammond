# Son-of-Hammond

This is one of my several game ideas, i've always wanted to do. Son of Hammond is (hopefuly) going to be a huge  complicated but great game to do almost anything in. Think of it as city builder game, mixed with Grand Theft Auto and any and most RPG's, all in a top-down perspective and retro-styled 16-bit. I've already made a start with the main menu but it still needs a load of work. As mentioned, this is currenlty a future plan not even at the stage of work in progress as I have many projects on the go all the time this will indeed be a time-conumming on.

## What are some key features that I plan to impliment into the game
So, my plans are to start off with basic green grass field with basic buildings so a very very small hamlet and there will be one person to meet the player to guide them on how to play (or at least the basics). I'm not a fan of being forced to go through a game tutorial whether I know how to play or not so I intend to keep this optional for the player.

Being able to enter buildings and each building being suitable for what they are. For example entering a school would be long corridors, many floors and classrooms, dining hall, etc. Buildings would have locked doors meaning you couldn't just walk into any.

There would be a suitable menu to choose how to interact with each NPC, I have plans to use Machine Learning for them to respond to inputs that way the user is more free to be themselves, but this would of course require a lot of data. In addition to all this it would also have many systems built into this, so being able to building buildings (choose where buildings go as there would be workers that build them for you). You will of course be able to become stronger, leave the hamlet/village/town/city and explore other terrians, locations, cities, etc. 

There is a main story line to the game so you can actuallly (without debating it) say you've finished the game. The story links in with the name of the game (I guess you could say the name of the game is a little bit of an advanced forshadow), I have plans to impliment a building into the game that magically appears when the main story is complete. This new building would allow the player to play new stories (short and long) which gives the island more history to it, including space travel and weird time travel, and of course a few more **normal** stories. There are many more features and plans I have which I may consider converting my paper-based plans to the wiki here.

## what are my goals to this?
I have plans to be doing this completly in python from head to tail. There are several reasons for this because c# and C++ would be more benefical and just overall better. Python is currently my main language as I have tried most areas of programming/development with it, so I have a good grip on it. Doing a little bit of research into popular games that are made with python, there doesn't seem to be that many that are purly just "python" that I would consider popular. This is quite understandable. But my goal is to build this game, using the most effient code (e.g., generators instead of for loops), keep the game as fast as possible, and of course show that python can be used for large things if programmed correctly.

I have no plans to be using python.Net for this as that wouldn't make is just python and I won't be using rust to do the intensive parts for python either. Just plain python, plain interpter.

In addition to the mentioned goals, there is one other that I'm doing just to prove something to myself if not other's. I've heard many of times that games made in modern day can't be fully developed by one person because it includes the logical programming, then the scripting, the sprites and art work, music, game testing, game mechanics, animation of sprites, ML/AI, ect. That's a lot but I do intend to make all of this myself. I will be using pygame for this (explained why in the next section below), I've worked on pixel sprite art a tiny bit but is something I want to get better at, I've never tried to make music or sound effects at all for games or anything so that will be fun to learn. I could use something like RPGMaker but 

## A bit about my game experience
So I do play games both modern and retro, I'm more a fan of older ones for both their graphics and stories as well as interesting mechanics. In terms of programming a game, I've used pygame for most python based games and I've done tiny bits with c# with and without unity. I've never done animated sprites before as well as many other things that will need to be included in this RPG.
