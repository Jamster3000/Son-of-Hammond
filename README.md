# Son of Hammond

Son of Hammond is one of my game ideas that I've always wanted to bring to life. This game aims to be a massive, complex, and engaging experience, allowing players to do almost anything they can imagine. Think of it as a city builder game mixed with elements from Grand Theft Auto and various RPGs, all presented in a top-down perspective with a retro-styled 16-bit aesthetic. I've made a start with the main menu, but there's still a lot of work to be done. This project is currently a future plan and not yet in the work-in-progress stage, as I have many ongoing projects.

## Current Implementations
### sohIO (S-O-you-eye)
Started working on a custom made module for the game's UI. The game's UI will include things such as the pause menu, inventory menu, etc. 
The UI currently has implimentations for buttons, single or mulit-line input box, and a list box.

## Key Features

### Starting Point
- **Initial Environment**: The game begins in a basic green grass field with simple buildings, forming a very small hamlet.
- **Guidance**: One character will meet the player to guide them on how to play, but this tutorial will be optional to avoid forcing players into it.

### Building Interaction
- **Entering Buildings**: Players can enter buildings, each with interiors suitable for their purpose (e.g., schools with corridors, floors, classrooms, dining halls).
- **Locked Doors**: Not all buildings will be accessible immediately, with some doors locked.

### NPC Interaction
- **Dynamic Responses**: There will be a menu for interacting with NPCs, using machine learning to allow NPCs to respond dynamically to player inputs, making interactions feel more natural and personalized.

### Building and Exploration
- **Construction**: Players can build structures and decide their placement, with workers carrying out the construction.
- **Character Development**: Players can become stronger, leave the initial hamlet, and explore various terrains, locations, and cities.

### Main Storyline
- **Completion and Continuation**: The game will have a main storyline, and once completed, a new building will appear, offering additional stories (short and long) that add more history to the island. These will include space travel, time travel, and other unique narratives.

## Goals

### Python-Centric Development
- **Language Choice**: The entire game will be developed in Python from start to finish. While languages like C# and C++ might be more efficient, Python is my main language, and I want to demonstrate its potential for large-scale projects.
- **Efficiency**: The goal is to use efficient code practices (e.g., generators instead of for loops) to keep the game running smoothly.
